            <li>olive oil cooking spray </li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package ziti pasta </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>½ (8 ounce) package fresh spinach, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) package fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) container part-skim ricotta cheese </li>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute spinach and mushrooms in the hot oil until soft, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add to ziti.</li>
            <li>Add ricotta cheese, goat cheese, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese to the ziti mixture; combine thoroughly. Mix in spaghetti sauce and transfer to the prepared baking pan. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella cheese.</strong></li>
            <li>Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until bubbly and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
